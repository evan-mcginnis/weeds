521 Parameter Selection

Python requirements are given in requirements.txt, but really just come down to a few things
numpy
opencv
scikit-learn

All interactions are with make. If you are running this on ubuntu, you probably already have this
There are two makefiles, Makefile and info521.mk, with the latter just for feature selection

Selecting the parameters
------------------------
Parameter Selection is accomplished with these subclasses of Select: Univariate, FeatureImportance, PrincipleComponentAnalysis, and Recursive
make -f info521.mk univariate
make -f info521.mk importance
make -f info521.mk pca
make -f info521.mk recursive

For this, you don't need opencv, just scikit-learn.


Training and processing images
==============================
To run the training and produce output, you will need to have opencv installed, otherwise you will run into errors.

Run the train/test with these commands. Each of these will take images from the input2 directory and put both segmented
and annotated results in the output directory.

Logistic regression
-------------------
make weeds PARAMETERS=reduced-parameters.csv TRAINING=training-521.csv ML=lr

A typical run would look like this. Where all those 1s and 0s are the predicted classes

C:\University of Arizona\machine-learning\final_project_optionb-evan-mcginnis>make weeds PARAMETERS=reduced-parameters.csv TRAINING=training-521.csv ML=lr
python weeds.py -i input2 -o output -a ndi -t "(130,0)" -df training-521.csv -l -sc -v -lg info-logging.yaml -se reduced-parameters.csv
